\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
I will forever be grateful to my family and friends who have supported me through thick and thin. 

I have loved working on this topic and I thank my supervisor, Prof. Mikko Kurimo, for giving me the opportunity and steering me in the right direction throughout my thesis. I have enjoyed working with Aku Rouhe, whose calm and knowledgeable feedback has driven most of the work in this thesis. I have looked to meetings with Aku, whenever I felt confused, and I thank him for providing some much-needed inspiration. I wish that the pandemic would have allowed us to have more offline interactions. 

The work was done in the Aalto ASR group, and I would like to thank every group member. I thank the Aalto Scientific Computing group for the help with using the cluster computation resources. They have been helpful and friendly when solving my issues with Triton on their garage sessions. I thank Prof. Jukka Sihvonen, for providing me the access to the dataset, without which this work would not have existed. I thank Prof. Sebastian M\"oller for remotely supervising this work.

Finally, I thank you, the reader, for taking time to glance through this work. I hope you enjoy it!
